# Micolet coding challenge

# Objectives

- The email and user preferences must be stored in Database.
- The same email cannot be registered twice, an error message will be displayed to the user indicating that the email already exists.
- Make a simple validation of the user's input to guarantee that what they have entered complies with the valid format of an email.
- The user may select one or more preferences, but they must select at least one of them.
- Once the user has been registered successfully, an email will be sent confirming their subscription.

Extra Ball 1 (Optional):

- Even if the email has a valid format, that does not mean that it is an existing email. It could be that the domain does not exist, or it is not configured to receive mail. To prevent submitting this type of emails, we will only accept those that obtain a score greater than 0.7 when looking up in this API:

Extra Ball 2 (Optional):

- The landing page will be used in several countries, therefore it should be prepared to adapt it to different languages. This is what we know in software development as internationalization (i18n).

# Description of the Project

For the development of the project, the following tools were used:

- Rails v 2.7.2
- Bootstrap v 5.1

The purpose of the excersice is to build a simple landing page with a functional newsletter submission. Postgresql was used mainly to use the array functionality to save the subscriber's preference.

The project has a simple landing page with a functional newsletter subscription.
